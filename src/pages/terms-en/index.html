            </p>
            <p>
              Engaging in trades may be risky, especially if you use sophisticated trading options. Please do not use COINANT or any of

              <li>Digital assets are primarily used by speculators, and are used relatively less on retail and commercial markets;
                digital asset transactions are highly risky, due to the fact that they are traded throughout 24-hour a day
                without limits on the rise or fall in price, and market makers and global government policies may cause major
                fluctuations in their prices;</li>
              <li>Digital asset transactions may be suspended or prohibited at any time due to the enactment or modification
                of national laws, regulations and regulatory documents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Digital assets trading is highly risky and therefore not suitable for the vast majority of people. You acknowledge
              and understand that investment in digital assets may result in partial or total loss of your investment and
              therefore you are advised to decide the amount of your investment on the basis of your loss-bearing capacity.
              You acknowledge and understand that digital assets may generate derivative risks. Therefore, if you have any
              doubt, you are advised to seek assistance from a financial adviser first. Furthermore, aside from the above-mentioned
              risks, there may also be unpredictable risks. Therefore, you are advised to carefully consider and use clear
              judgment to assess your financial position and the abovementioned risks before making any decisions on buying
              and selling digital assets; any and all losses arising therefrom will be borne by you and we shall not be held
              liable in any manner whatsoever.</p>
            <p>When you use the service of https://www.coinant.io/ and other concerning website, that means you have a completely
              knowledge of the trading risk and decide to take responsible for the risk. If you can not stand for the risk,
